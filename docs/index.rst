workflows with automation. It additionally pairs well with environments like
Jupyter Notebooks.

<https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/cli.html#the-openstack-rc-script>`_
to learn more about how to download and source your authentication credentials
for the CLI; the same instructions apply for using the Python interface.

Basic usage
===========

The following example shows how to make a reservation for a bare metal server.
For more details about the modules available refer to their respective pages.

.. code-block:: python

  import chi

  # Select your project
  chi.set('project_name', 'CH-XXXXXX')
  # Select your site
  chi.use_site('CHI@UC')

  # Make a reservation
  reservations = []
  chi.lease.add_node_reservation(
    reservations, node_type='compute_skylake', count=1)
  start_date, end_date = chi.lease.lease_duration(days=1)
  blazar().lease.create(name=lease_name,
                        start=start_date,
                        end=end_date,
