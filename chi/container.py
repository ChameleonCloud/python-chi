        image (str): The Docker image, with or without tag information. If no
            tag is provided, "latest" is assumed.
        image_driver (str): The image storage driver to use to retrieve the
            image. Defaults to "docker", meaning the image is assumed to be a
            Docker registry repository. Specify "glance" to launch a snapshot
            image by passing the Glance Image ID in the ``image`` argument.
        device_profiles (list[str]): An optional list of device profiles to
            request be configured on the container when it is created. Edge
            devices may have differing sets of supported device profiles, so
            it is important to understand which profiles are supported by the
            target device for your container.
        environment (dict): A set of environment variables to pass to the
            container.
        exposed_ports (list[str]): A list of ports to expose on the container.
            TCP or UDP can be provided with a slash prefix, e.g., "80/tcp" vs.
            "53/udp". If no protocol is provided, TCP is assumed.
        nets (list[dict]): A set of network configurations. This is an advanced
            invocation; typically ``network_id`` or ``network_name`` should be
            enough, and is much simpler. Refer to the `Zun documentation

            for information about this parameter.
        network_id (str): The ID of a network to launch the container on.
        network_name (str): The name of a network to launch the container on.
            This has no effect if ``network_id`` is already provided. Default
            "containernet1".
        host (str): The Zun host to launch a container on. If not specified,
            the host is chosen by Zun.
        runtime (str): The container runtime to use. This should only be
            overridden when explicitly launching containers onto a host/platform
            requiring a separate runtime to, e.g., pass-through GPU devices,
            such as the "nvidia" runtime provided by NVIDIA Jetson Nano/TX2.
        start (bool): Whether to automatically start the container after it
            is created. Default True.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to send to the Zun client's
            container create call.
